# Assignment 1: A Simple Example
- origin:
fix the original code from systemc 2.0, guarantee it works in systemc 2.3 enviroment
- src:
assignment 1 source code
- log:
contain each of output log of module
# Project 1: Accellera Taiwan Forum
A 10-page report about what you learned at the Accellera Taiwan Forum.
# Assignment 2: High Level Synthesize
- Design 1: Half and Full Adders
Implement a half-adder, then use two half-adders to implement a full adder. </br>
Then synthesize the full adder using Cadence CTOS.
- Design 2: Finite Impulse Response Digital Filter
Implement a 16th-order discrete-time Finite Impulse Response (FIR) digital filter, in 50MHz clock.</br> 
Then synthesize the filter using Cadence CTOS.
